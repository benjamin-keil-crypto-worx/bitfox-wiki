**Warning**

<p>
This application is under heavy development and in beta nothing has been tested.
This version of bitfox is in beta and has been published to undergo a UAT and QA cycle

**Use this tool and library at your own risk!**

We are in the process of implementing a comprehensive list of examples and examples you can find those in the bitfox example directory.
Before you start reading this Documentation we recommend strongly you have a look at the examples first, as the Documentation might not be up to date with latest
features of bitfox plus understanding the examples available, will give you an edge over this documentation as it just covers the bases of bitfox!
